    <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-700">
      I'm a passionate and curious individual with a strong foundation in electronics engineering and a growing expertise in software development.
      Whether I'm designing circuit systems or building interactive web apps, I enjoy solving real-world problems with thoughtful, efficient solutions.
      I have a particular interest in projects that blend hardware and software, and I'm always eager to learn new technologies, collaborate with creative people, and push the limits of what I can do.
